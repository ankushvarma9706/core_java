Abstraction
------------------
1. It is a process in which hiding implementation and showing only functionality to the use
2. Abstraction can be achieved  by
     |- Abstract Class
     |- Interface


Abstract Class
================
1. If we  assign 'abstract' keyword of the class , then we can say that class is  an Abstract Class .
2. Abstract Class  consist abstract method and non-abstract method .

        abstract method |-  abstract void show();

    non-abstract method |-   void show()
                             {

                             }

  3. If we create an abstract class it is compulsory to create a child class of that abstract class .
  4. Child class is responsible  to override the  abstract method .
  5. We cant create an  object of abstract class .

         Test1
         Test2
