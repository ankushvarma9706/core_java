Abstraction
------------------
1. It is a process in which hiding implementation and showing only functionality to the user
2. Abstraction can be achieved  by
     |- Abstract Class
     |- Interface


Abstract Class
================
1. If we  assign 'abstract' keyword of the class , then we can say that class is  an Abstract Class .
2. Abstract Class  consist abstract method and non-abstract method .

        abstract method |-  abstract void show();

    non-abstract method |-   void show()
                             {

                             }

  3. If we create an abstract class it is compulsory to create a child class of that abstract class .
  4. Child class is responsible  to override the  abstract method .
  5. We cant create an  object of abstract class .
  6.

  Example :
         Test1
         Test2
         Test3
         Test5.java

=====================================================================================





Interfaces
-------------
1. It is use to achieve Abstraction .
2. It is also use to achieve Multiple Inheritance .
3. By using interface, program become loosely coupled .
4. Syntax :
    interface (interface-name)
    {
    // elements
    }

5. Relation B/W Classes and interfaces .
6. Internal details of Interface .
7. We cant create objects of interfaces .
